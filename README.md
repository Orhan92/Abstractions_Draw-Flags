# Lektion-16.-Abstractions---Draw-Flags
 
In this repository we are going to cover how to draw colored lines.

We will do this by creating existing country flags and printing it out to the console.

We shall also try to put as much of the code into abstractions. In other words, I will put as much of the repeated code as I can into Methods.
